This is a basic poll dapp that includes both a backend canister and a frontend canister. Backend canisters are used to host the dapp's smart contract code, while frontend canisters are used to host user interface assets, such as HTML and CSS.

The poll dapp will ask the end user a question, then have them vote on which answer they'd like to select.
